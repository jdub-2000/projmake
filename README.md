# projmake (WIP)
 
A very basic utility to setup predicatble directory patterns
for starting new projects.  Also, an excuse to learn `Rust`!

This project is just getting started, and I hope to use it as an application
and framework to learn more `Rust` along the way.  In the meantime, I'll try to make
this useful with what I know, and update as I go along my journey. :)

## Installation and Setup 

1. Clone the `projmake` repository, and enter the repo directory

```
git clone git@github.com:jdub-2000/projmake.git &&
cd projmake
```

2. Compile `projmake` using `cargo`

```
cargo build --release
```

if all goes well, a binary will placed in the following directory:

`/projmake/target/release/projmake`

3. Make a copy of that binary and place it in the `/usr/bin` directory:

```
sudo cp <full_path_to>/projmake/target/release/projmake /usr/bin/
```

4. Exit the terminal

```
exit
```

You should now be able to invoke the compiled binary no matter where you "are" in the filesystem.  See below for Usage instructions.
